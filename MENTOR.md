I figured I'd add this file so that I can record thoughts as we go
along, and then refer to back to them after the fact. I'll try to keep
this file mostly append-only (well, maybe prepend-only) so that it's
easy to keep track of changes. You can also use

```console
$ git log -- MENTOR.md
```

to get a historical view of any changes that have been made.

A few early thoughts and recommendations:

 - A long time ago, I wrote
   [rucache](https://github.com/jonhoo/rucache), which was an early
   attempt at writing a memcached in Rust. I didn't get a chance to do
   much polish on it, but it might provide you with some code to read.
 - I highly recommend that you join the `#rust-beginners` channel on
   IRC. You can do so either with any IRC program (instructions
   [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Getting_Started_with_IRC)
   and [here](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC)), or directly in your
   browser by using
   [mibbit](https://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust-beginners).
   The `#rust-beginners` channel is an excellent resource for asking
   questions and getting answers from more experienced Rust developers,
   and the channel is not logged, so feel free to also ask questions you
   may think are basic or silly. The Rust community is a friendly bunch,
   and will happily help you out!
