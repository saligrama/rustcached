I figured I'd add this file so that I can record thoughts as we go
along, and then refer to back to them after the fact. I'll try to keep
this file mostly append-only (well, maybe prepend-only) so that it's
easy to keep track of changes. You can also use

```console
$ git log -- MENTOR.md
```

to get a historical view of any changes that have been made.
